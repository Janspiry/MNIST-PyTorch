### **LeNet5** implement for image classification task on **MNIST** dataset by **PyTorch** 

###### This is "Hello World" program in CNN



### Requirement

Jupyter Notebook
PyTorch >= 0.4.0
torchvision >= 0.1.8



### Accuracy 

99%  just by a epoch 



### Usage

```
$git clone https://github.com/Janspiry/MNIST-PyTorch.git  
$cd MNIST-PyTorch  
```



### Detail

The network framework is like following pictureï¼Œthe only difference is that the picture size of MNIST is 28 * 28 rather than 32 * 32.
